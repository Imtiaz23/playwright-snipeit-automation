- Keep you updated on our progress
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- Publicly disclose the vulnerability in a responsible manner

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using this project:

#### For Test Data
- Never use real credentials in test configurations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Avoid committing sensitive information to version control
- Use test-specific user accounts with minimal privileges

#### For Test Environments
- Only run tests against dedicated test environments
- Ensure test environments are properly isolated
- Use HTTPS connections when possible
- Regularly update dependencies

#### For CI/CD
- Secure your CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls
- Use secrets management for sensitive configuration
- Limit test execution to authorized environments
- Monitor test execution logs for anomalies

### 🔧 Configuration Security

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
SNIPEIT_USERNAME=test_user
SNIPEIT_PASSWORD=secure_password
SNIPEIT_BASE_URL=https://test.snipeitapp.com
```

#### Test Configuration
```csharp
// Don't commit real credentials
public static class TestConfiguration
{
    public static string Username => Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SNIPEIT_USERNAME") ?? "demo_user";
    public static string Password => Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SNIPEIT_PASSWORD") ?? "demo_password";
}
```

### 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are generally **NOT** considered security vulnerabilities for this project:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to the respective projects)
- Issues with the target application being tested (SnipeIT demo site)
- Browser-specific security issues
- Test environment misconfigurations
- Rate limiting or denial of service from excessive test execution

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our project safe. With your permission, we will:

- Acknowledge your contribution in our changelog
- Add you to our security contributors list
- Provide public recognition (if desired)
